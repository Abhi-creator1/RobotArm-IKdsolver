# Inverse Kinematics Solver for 4-DOF Robot Arm (ROS2)

![Project Demo](assets/Screenshot 2.png)

A ROS2-based project demonstrating **real-time control and simulation** of a custom **4-DOF robotic arm** using inverse kinematics (IK).  
The arm is controlled via **interactive markers in RViz**, allowing users to move the end-effector in 3D space while the solver calculates and updates joint positions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **4-DOF Robotic Arm** â€“ Base, shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints designed for smooth and precise control.  
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver** â€“ Computes joint angles to reach any target pose within the armâ€™s workspace.  
- **ROS2 Integration (Humble)** â€“ Built with ROS2, making it compatible with modern robotics systems.  
- **Interactive RViz Control** â€“ Use drag-and-drop interactive markers to position the end-effector.  
- **URDF Model with Custom Meshes** â€“ A visually detailed and physically accurate robot model.

- ROS2 packages:
  - `interactive_markers`
  - `geometry_msgs`

---

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhi-creator1/RobotArm-IKdsolver.git
    mv RobotArm-IKdsolver my_robot_arm
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure ROS2 Humble is installed and sourced:
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    sudo apt install ros-humble-interactive-markers ros-humble-geometry-msgs
    ```

3. **Build the workspace:**
    ```bash
    colcon build --symlink-install
    ```

4. **Source the workspace:**
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

5. **Run the project:**
    ```bash
    ros2 launch my_robot_arm display.launch.py
    ```

---

## ðŸŽ® Usage
1. Launch RViz and load the robot model.  
2. Move the interactive marker in 3D space to control the end-effector (TCP).  
3. The inverse kinematics solver will compute and update joint positions automatically.
